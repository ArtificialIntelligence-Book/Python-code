"""
Commonsense Inference Example for a Neuro-Symbolic AI System

This example illustrates a simple neuro-symbolic system making a commonsense inference:
Given perceptual input (e.g., an object detected by a neural network), the symbolic
reasoning module applies commonsense rules to infer related facts about the object.

Example Commonsense Inference:
- If an object is recognized as a "dog", then it "can bark".
- If an object is recognized as a "bird", then it "can fly".
- If an object is recognized as a "car", then it "can drive".

Key components:
1. Neural Perception module (simulated here as direct input).
2. Symbolic Reasoning module with commonsense rules.
3. Integration that outputs inferred commonsense conclusions.

This simple framework can be extended to more complex neuro-symbolic reasoning.
