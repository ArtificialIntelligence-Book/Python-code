"""
Grover's Algorithm - Simplified Quantum Search Simulation in Python

Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems
by amplifying the probability amplitude of the correct solution(s) using quantum
amplitude amplification.

This code simulates Grover's algorithm for a search problem using classical linear algebra
to illustrate the core quantum principles in a small state space.

Key points:
- State vector initialized in uniform superposition.
- Oracle flips phase of the target state.
- Diffusion operator amplifies the target amplitude.
- Iterative application increases probability of measuring the target.
- Demonstrates how Grover's algorithm can be a building block for AI optimization.

Potential AI applications:
- Searching large solution spaces (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, combinatorial optimization).
- Speeding up constraint satisfaction problems.
- Quantum-enhanced heuristic search or sampling.

"""
Notes:

- This simulation uses numpy arrays to represent quantum states.
- The oracle flips the amplitude sign of the target index (phase inversion).
- The diffusion operator amplifies target amplitude by inverting about the mean.
- Grover's algorithm approximately needs ~Ï€/4 * sqrt(N) iterations for max success probability.
- In AI, Grover's algorithm concepts inspire efficient search and optimization heuristics.
